EMT & Paramedic Duties

- Responding to 911 calls
- Providing first aid, CPR and resuscitation
- Assessing a patient’s health and current condition
- Deciding on immediate care based on the assessment
- Providing life support
- Transporting patients in an ambulance to an emergency room or hospital
- Transporting patients from the ambulance into the hospital
- Communicating with nurses, doctors, and other health care professionals
- Documenting care given to patients
- Cleaning, replacing, and inventorying equipment

Where EMTs and paramedic practitioners differ is in the types of care that may be administered to a patient. In general, an EMT is not allowed to perform any procedure that punctures the patient’s skin. An exception to this is the use of life-saving injections, such as an epinephrine auto-injector used to treat anaphylaxis from an allergic reaction or the medication used to reverse an overdose caused by opioid drugs.

Other procedures that paramedics may perform, and that EMTs do not, include administering medications, inserting intravenous lines and administering fluids, using and interpreting electrocardiograms, using other advanced health and life support monitors, providing advanced airway management, and caring for and administering life support for patients with significant health problems, like trauma or cardiac arrest.
