### Duties of agents  


An agent is required to:  
- **Act on behalf of his principal**. Thus, losses suffered by the principal if his agent fails to  act are recoverable.  
- **Obey all lawful and reasonable instructions**, and carry out instructions with reasonable  care and skill.  

    An agent may well owe a duty of care in negligence to his principal, so that a  professional adviser who is an agent should display such skill as could be expected from  a member of his profession.  

    Moreover, it is an implied term of a contract for the supply of services (such as agency)  that those services will be rendered with reasonable skill (Supply of Goods and Services  Act 1982).  

    The duty is to exercise due care and skill. It is not a duty to be right.  

- **Comply with fiduciary duties**. All agents owe fiduciary duties (duties of good faith) to  their principals. Breach of fiduciary duty arises if an agent breaks his duty whether or not  this was his intention. 

    The principal fiduciary duties are to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest  and not to take bribes or make secret profits.  
    - **Conflict of interests**. If the agent’s interests clash (or could clash) with those of  his principal, he must fully disclose this conflict so that the principal can decide  whether to continue with the transaction. Failure to make full disclosure entitles  the principal to set the transaction aside, claim any profit the agent may have  made and refuse to pay commission.  

        A conflict of interest would arise if an agent sought to buy his principal’s property  or sell his own property to his principal or if he acted for both parties to a  transaction.  
    - **Bribes and secret profits**. An agent who, without his principal’s knowledge,  makes a profit for himself by virtue of his position must account for that profit to his principal. This is the case even if the agent has acted honestly and even if the  agent’s acts have conferred benefits on his principal.  
    
        Thus in **Boardman v Phipps (1967)** a solicitor who used his knowledge, acquired  as an agent, to revitalize a company, thereby benefiting his principal (a  shareholder in the company) was required to pay his principal the enhancement in  value of his own shares in the company. 
- **Comply with other duties**. These duties include:  
    - not to delegate unless authorized to do so;  
    - to keep proper accounts and to pay to his principal money received on his behalf.  

### Rights of agents  
Three (3) rights may exist.  
1) **Remuneration** 
    Agents who render services usually charge according to the time spent on such services. Agents  who are employed to achieve a result, such as a sale usually charge fees on a commission basis.  Estate agents fall into the latter category and so usually receive no remuneration for work done  where the result has not been achieved.

    The mere occurrence of the transaction which the agent is commissioned to effect does not  entitle the agent to remuneration; the occurrence must be brought about by the agent unless the  contract provides that he is to be paid however the desired result occurred.  
    Even if an agent complies with his instructions he cannot recover any commission in respect of a  transaction rendered void or illegal by statute. An agent who is in breach of his duties towards  his principal normally forfeits his right to commission, unless the breach is a technical one and  the agent acted honestly.

    Therefore, in summarizing, the words of Lord Wright in **Luxor v. Cooper [1940]** as follows should also be noted: 
    
    ___Lord Wright in Luxor v. Cooper [1940]___

    “The principle only promise is that he will pay commission if the contract is completed. There is  no promise to pay commission if the principle revokes the authority of the agent and further  objecting to a claim on quantum merit that the employer has not obtained any benefit the agent  has earned nothing until the event materializes. Therefore, if commission is to be payable before  the result is achieved, it must be expressly provided in the contract.”

2) **Indemnity** 
An agent who incurs losses or liabilities in the course of carrying out authorized, legal actions for  his principal is entitled to reimbursement or an indemnity. 

    This right exists for all agents, regardless of whether they are entitled to remuneration.  Contractual terms may limit the scope of any indemnity.  

3) **Lien**. (security interest) 
Unless otherwise agreed, A is entitled to a lien on all P’s property that comes into his possession  during the agency.  
    
    All agents have a particular lien, that is, the right to hold the property until all A’s claims against  P under the agency have been met. Some agents (such as solicitors, bankers and stockbrokers)  expressly or by custom have a general lien, that is, a right arising to protect A’s claims against P,  whether related to the agency or not.  


### Termination of agency  
A contract of agency may be terminated, like any other contract, by agreement, performance,  repudiatory breach (fundamental breach of a contract that it permits the distressed party to terminate  performance of the contract, in addition to entitling that party to sue for damages) or frustration.  

P may dismiss A at any time: depending on the terms of the agreement, this may constitute a  breach of contract giving rise to damages. However, since agency is a personal relationship, the  court will not order specific performance. Agency is also terminated in the following ways: 

- **By death of either party.** Transactions entered into after the death of the principal bind  the agent but not the principal’s estate and the agent may become liable for breach of  warranty of authority.  
- **By insanity.** If a principal becomes insane the agency determines and the agent’s actual  authority ceases. An agent (even if he does not know of the insanity) who acts for his  principal after the insanity and consequent termination of authority is liable to a third  party for breach of warranty of authority – unless the third party knew of the insanity.  
Under the Enduring Powers of Attorney Act 1985 it is now possible to create an enduring  power of attorney which will not be brought to an end by the mental incapacity of the  donor. 
- **By bankruptcy.** Bankruptcy of the principal terminates the contract of agency.  Bankruptcy of the agent terminates the agency if it prevents him from acting as an agent.
