## General Rules

- It is your responsibility to remain informed of any rule changes listed here or in Discord. (They are subject to change without notice.)
- You are not allowed to play any content that is under copyright protection (DCMA), such as movies on the TV and DMCA music on the boombox.
- Do not influence others to break rules, you will receive a similar punishment.
- Do not use any real-life events in the city. No suicide RP, real-life terrorism threats, pandemics or mental illnesses, not limited to these examples.
- No racism, trolling, homophobia and sexism.
- Treat every person with respect, Everyone is equal.
- You must have a working, clear microphone. Failing to do so may result in a kick or ban.
- Using derogatory terms such as, but not limited to the word “retard”, is a bannable offense.
- Attacking members in other Discord servers, YouTube, Twitter, etc. is prohibited and punishable.
- You cannot play OOC content, such as RP montages and Twitch streams, on the in-game TVs.
- Basic Decency & Respect
    - While our goal is to foster a roleplaying experience free from constraints, We realize we must protect all members of our community regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, etc. We strive to create a welcoming, friendly, and peaceful atmosphere for all members. A community that members can be proud to say they are a part of. Maple Hearts takes a hard stance against any derogatory terms or actions against its members. We will enforce a strict code of conduct within our community and act on distasteful items, for example, and not limited to Sexual Harassment, Excessive Name-Calling And/Or Shaming, Disrespectful Attacks on a Personal Level, etc.
    - At the end of the day, we are all here to enjoy a world outside of the one we live in. We are here to escape to a world where we can create a new life with amazing experiences. Simply put, respect one another. Have justification and reasoning for your actions. Simply saying "It's My Character" will result in being banned without question. It's not a valid response.

## Deathmatching (RDM/VDM)
  - RDM - Random Death-Match
    - RDM is not allowed by any means, In short, RDM is Killing/Attempting to kill someone without intending to roleplay or without proper initiation.
    - All deadly actions need to be slowly done, after some time after the initial start of the scene. 
    - Deadly actions have to be roleplayed out, there is no such thing as Killing on-site, it's seen as a form of RDM. 
    - You **MUST** initiate proper roleplay for every kill.
    - **Examples**:
      1) Someone talked trash towards you, so you withdraw a firearm and shoot them. That is RDM.
      2) You provoke a fist fight then proceed to pull out a firearm and kill the person you provoked
  - VDM - Vehicle Death-Match
    - VDM is not allowed by any means, In short, VDM is using a vehicle as an intentional weapon to kill someone.
    - **Examples**:
        1) Someone insulted you, so you ran them over
        2) Someone accidentally hit your car, so you ram them with your vehicle multiple times
        3) Someone robbed you beforehand, so you ram their vehicle to stop them and force them out of it.

## Account & Donations
  - Accounts & Characters
    - Anything that occurs on your account is your responsibility.
    - Should you lose access to your Discord/CFX/Steam/Rockstar account, we are not able to transfer the Whitelist status to another discord.
    - It is prohibited to buy or sell any account and/or items from another user other than the official donation packages. 
    - Players are not allowed to create new characters with the intent to transfer the starter money over to another character. All involved players or parties breaking this rule will have their money revoked from them and be banned. You are also not allowed to transfer any assets your character has to any other character for any reason.
    - Police, DOC, EMS, Doctors, Fire, and any other government official are not allowed to be corrupt. An example of such would be giving away or selling government-only equipment.
    - Make sure you separate your characters. They do not know each other, they do not know where your weed location is, or who your friends/enemies are. etc. Other characters you create are not your "cousin". They can't ever meet up, so that is extremely unrealistic.
    - Anything in Discord that starts with IC- is in character. I.e #ic-content & #ic-story-continuation
    - You are not allowed to have multiple characters that are affiliated with the same circle/gang. You must separate your rp.
    - If a player has a camera of any sort on their character, they can use recordings as legal evidence, otherwise, they cannot.
    - Serial Killers/Robots/Paranormal Characters, etc.. must be approved by the staff team via a Discord ticket.
    - Indicating that you have no pulse three or more times, will result in the permanent death of your character.
  - Donations
    - All donations/purchases are permanent and non-refundable
    - All purchases/donations are tied to your account and you will be asked what character you want the donation perks to. You cannot change your mind in the future once they are given or transfer them after.
    - In a situation where a buyer is banned for violating the server rules, any purchases made by the buyer will not be refunded, remember that buyers are held responsible for their actions, just as any other player.
    - In the instance of a chargeback, you will not be allowed to appeal any bans resulting from violating server rules.
