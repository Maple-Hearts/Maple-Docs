## General Rules

- Basic Decency & Respect
    - While our goal is to foster a roleplaying experience free from constraints, We realize we must protect all members of our community regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, etc. We strive to create a welcoming, friendly, and peaceful atmosphere for all members. A community that members can be proud to say they are a part of. Maple Hearts takes a hard stance against any derogatory terms or actions against its members. We will enforce a strict code of conduct within our community and act on distasteful items, for example, and not limited to Sexual Harassment, Excessive Name-Calling And/Or Shaming, Disrespectful Attacks on a Personal Level, etc.
    - At the end of the day, we are all here to enjoy a world outside of the one we live in. We are here to escape to a world where we can create a new life with amazing experiences. Simply put, respect one another. Have justification and reasoning for your actions. Simply saying "It's My Character" will result in being banned without question. It's not a valid response.


- Deathmatching (RDM/VDM)
  - RDM - Random Death-Match
    - RDM is not allowed by any means, In short, RDM is Killing/Attempting to kill someone without intending to roleplay or without proper initiation.
    - All deadly actions need to be slowly done, after some time after the initial start of the scene. 
    - Deadly actions have to be roleplayed out, there is no such thing as Killing on-site, it's seen as a form of RDM. 
    - You **MUST** initiate proper roleplay for every kill.
    - **Examples**:
      1) Someone talked trash towards you, so you withdraw a firearm and shoot them. That is RDM.
      2) You provoke a fist fight then proceed to pull out a firearm and kill the person you provoked
  - VDM - Vehicle Death-Match
    - VDM is not allowed by any means, In short, VDM is using a vehicle as an intentional weapon to kill someone.
    - **Examples**:
        1) Someone insulted you, so you ran them over
        2) Someone accidentally hit your car, so you ram them with your vehicle multiple times
        3) Someone robbed you before hand, so you ram their vehicle to stop them, and force them out of it.`
