## Disclaimers

For the purpose of this document minutes in real life will be referred to as months (so as to be consistent with RP).


## Arrest Warrants

If a civilian has been convicted of an offense and refuses to pay, an arrest warrant may be issued without DOJ involvement.


## Search Warrants

When requesting a search warrant on an individual’s property, the LEO will will follow this list of contact until successful:



1. Ping the _@Judge_ role in the #Warrant-Services channel.
2.  If you are unable to get a response via that method within 1 hour, contact your watch commander (highest ranking deputy on duty [Watch command must be a Sergeant or higher])
3. Your **last resort** is to ping _@MHSO Command Staff_ in #Warrant-Services

When submitting a request for a warrant, you must use this format: \




* What type of property (vehicles are exempt, speak with your CoC for clarification)
* What probable cause do you have to search
* What do you expect to find
* Why you expect to find the property described at that location

Lastly, you must sign your request, this is binding and is to say that to the best of your knowledge all above information is true and accurate at the time of filing.

**Example request:**

John Doe’s Apartment \
I watched him buy something and stuff it into his bag at a known drug house then go home

Drugs

I watched him take them home


## Bail

As long as the proposed sentence is less than 30 months, the subject is bailed out for $0. Remember that not every arrest needs a trial, only if it qualifies for one OR is requested. In either case if a trial is imminent the attorney assigned shall make their client aware of the bail cost and the accused party shall pay it before being set free and made aware of their court date.If they cannot afford their bail, they shall be covered by a bail bond should they decide to sign up with them. One Pride Security offers this service.

**Bail cost** explained: Bail cost is 250% of the fine amount and is paid in full by the subject or a bail bond service is requested. 

(Don’t let your client skip their court date! A warrant will be issued for their arrest and if a bail bond was used, they will attempt to collect their fugitive.)

**Flight risk** explained: If it is reasonable to believe that the suspect intends to or talks about skipping bail, this call may be made by the arresting officer. When a person is considered a flight risk their bail is set at 10 times the usual rate.

**How to bail out of incarceration**: Your attorney can request that your bail be accepted by the department and a Judge can approve it through our state of the art email server. \



## Cases


### **Case qualification**:

The current cutoff to **require **a court appearance are pending charges of more than 45 months (this may be changed in the future). 

Other cases may include claims of unlawful arrest or when a civilian’s constitutional rights have been violated. In that case it is up to the attorney to determine whether or not they want to take the case and that it has merit to be brought before a circuit court. If it does, follow the below instructions.

**Dealing with a qualifying arrest:**

When an arrest meets the requirements, a question arises:

Does the subject have an attorney they would like to hire for their case? If yes, they shall be notified by the deputy that they are needed and the location of their client. Otherwise, another question arises.

Is there a public defender available, if yes, they are assigned. Otherwise, the lowest cost private lawyer is assigned on behalf of the subject and the cost is absorbed by the State of MapleHearts.

After the subject is in contact with their attorney, **they are not to be questioned without their representation present**. \


**Attorneys: \
**Your first step after speaking with your client and law enforcement is to file for a case [here](https://forms.gle/gfBDsgQxWdpgvXpS8).

**Proposed sentence **explained: This is set by the deputy and should the attorney and prosecution not come to an agreement, the case goes to trial.

**Case ID** explained: The first two letters identify where the arrest took place (see chart below).

**Agencies**:

SO - MapleHearts Sheriff’s Office

MH - State Agency of MapleHearts

IA - Internal Affairs 

**Locations:**

LS - Los Santos

SS - Sandy Shores

PB - Paleto Bay

MC - Mount Chiliad State Wilderness

GP - Grapeseed

HM - Harmony 

UI - Unincorporated Area


## Prosecution 

At this time, if no prosecutor is available, a member of the CoC will bring the charges before a judge.This means learning as much about the case as possible so as to present the best evidence for why the subject should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.


## Contacting a Judge

Once the charges have been filed, a prosecutor is assigned and if the prosecutor/defense attorney cannot come to an agreement, a judge shall be contacted to schedule a court date and time.


## Court Dates

All court dates will require the following person’s schedules to align:

Judge

Accused persons

Defense attorney(s)

Prosecutor(s) **OR **Agency Rep.

Arresting deputy(s)

Witness’ (optional)

This can be difficult so it may take several attempts but at some point, if a date can not be established within 3 attempts, both sides will plead their case via text and a judgment will be made. 


## Lead time

Dates will be set with enough lead time so as to allow for discovery and case prep. 7 days is required for all cases, though some may require more.

Statute of Limitations

Cases must be filed within one week of the situation occurring so evidence may be obtained.


## Evidence

Evidence that is permissible in court:

Video recording

Audio recording

Affidavit 

Police report

Unbiased witness’

DNA evidence

Gunshot residue test

Field sobriety test

Breathalyzer result

Shell casings

Sworn confession

Other evidence based on the assigned Judge’s prior approval


## Civil Cases

Citizens are able to take each other to court for various reasons: \
Divorce

Wrongful termination

Wrongful death

Stolen property recovery

Rights violation

Much more

Attorneys file to have their client’s case heard and if accepted will need to provide proof that the defendant was notified (One Pride Security offers this service) and the Judge will find a date that works for all involved parties.
