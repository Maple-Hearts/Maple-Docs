# The MapleHearts Department of Justice presents:

## A Guide to the United States Supreme Court Case Law

!> Disclaimer: This document should only be used for Roleplay purposes.


### **Introduction**

The State Penal code allows for policies and procedures set by SCOTUS to be used in MapleHearts. Although law enforcement officers in MapleHearts use case law on a daily basis, they are often left wondering what they can/can’t do, simply because nothing about case law is written down in the Penal Code. This document aims to solve that issue.

Although we broke down these SCOTUS cases to highlight specific points, we recognize that not many people will read the document in its entirety. If that is the case, we ask that Law Enforcement Officers read the “What this means for Law Enforcement:” sections of this document, as that will provide the most useful information to them.

Regardless of whether a specific SCOTUS case is on this document or not, we expect Law Enforcement Officers to continue to acknowledge their limitations. This is merely a guide for law enforcement to gain knowledge in the most commonly used Supreme Court cases. This is not a guide that outlines every case law applicable to law enforcement in the history of the United States. Failure to abide by SCOTUS set limitations and/or the Penal Code may result in both in game and out of game consequences per LP 22. Arrest Policy in the Penal Code.

If you have a SCOTUS case that you feel should be added to this guide, feel free to fill out the JS Suggestion form under Legislative Suggestions.

**Carroll v. United States (267 U.S. 132 (1925))**

**Background:** In 1921, prohibition was in full effect and alcohol was illegal nationwide. Federal agents conducted an undercover operation where they attempted to purchase whiskey from two men. The undercover agents met with the men and they settled on a price. The two men left to get the whiskey but were unable to obtain it that night. They told the agents that they would be able to obtain the whiskey the next morning but never contacted the agents again.

Two months later, one of the agents from the operation was patrolling a road which was frequently used for the illegal transportation of liquor. During his patrol, the agent noticed the  suspects in the same vehicle that was seen in the prior operation.

After initiating a traffic stop on the vehicle they proceeded to search the vehicle without the consent of the driver. The agents then found 68 bottles of liquor hidden in the seats. As a result, both men were arrested and later convicted. They appealed the decision arguing that the search of the motor vehicle was a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

**Decision:** The Supreme Court upheld the conviction.The two men were known to transport liquor in that vehicle and frequented a route known for illegal liquor traffic. With those facts in mind, the Court found that the agents had probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained liquor. The court also established that searches on motor vehicles did not require a search warrant due to the fact that a vehicle can easily be moved out of the jurisdiction where the warrant was obtained.

**What this means for Law Enforcement: **A law enforcement officer can perform warrantless searches on any method of transportation that can quickly move out of jurisdiction (plane, car, train, etc.,) as long as you have probable cause that evidence is in the vehicle. With that in mind, a law enforcement officer may only search areas that are big enough to fit the items that they are looking for.

**Mapp v. Ohio  (367 US 643 (1961))**

**Background**: Police officers forced their way into Dollree Mapp's house without a proper search warrant. Police believed that Mapp was harboring a person suspected of making bombs and demanded entry. Although police didn’t find the suspect they were looking for, they did find a trunk full of obscene pictures in Mapp's basement. Mapp was arrested for possessing the pictures, and was convicted in an Ohio court. Mapp argued that her Fourth Amendment rights had been violated by the search

**Decision**: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5-3 vote in favor of Mapp. The high court said evidence seized unlawfully, without a search warrant, could not be used in criminal prosecutions in state courts.

**What does this mean for you: **Officers may not search a house without a search warrant. If they do, the evidence will be deemed inadmissible in court.

-------------------------

**Miranda v. Arizona  (384 U.S. 436 (1966))**

**Background**: Ernesto Miranda was arrested in Phoenix for kidnapping and rape. He was taken into custody and transported to the police department where he was interrogated for over two hours, and signed a written statement confessing to both crimes “knowingly and voluntarily”. In court, Miranda’s lawyers argued that the confession be dismissed, claiming that he didn’t know his rights.

**Decision**: The court sided with Miranda. Under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, statements made by a defendant during interrogation are only admissible as evidence if law enforcement informs the defendant of their rights to remain silent and speak to an attorney before interrogation. These rights must be exercised or waived knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.

**What does this mean for you: **This case is the origin of law enforcement’s requirement for reading a suspect in custody their “Miranda Rights”.

The two criteria need to be met in order for an officer to be required to give miranda rights is as follows:

1. The person must be in detained (when a reasonable person does not feel as though they have the freedom to leave)

2. You must ask the person specific questions about the crime (i.e. “Did you rob the store”) Asking vague questions (i.e. “What were you doing in the store?”) does not satisfy this requirement.

You may note that Miranda does not apply to questioning during traffic stops. It also does not apply to individuals who voluntarily provide self incriminating information pertaining to the crime without questioning (while in custody or not).

One other notable exception to the rule is the Public Safety Exception that allows an otherwise suppressible statement made by a defendant relating to information that the police needed at the time it was made in order to protect the public. Instances where this exception would be applicable to are, but not limited to, crime involving a weapon, knowledge of other suspects, location of victim(s), etc.

Miranda warnings should go as follows: “You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law, you have the right to an attorney, and if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.”

**Terry v. Ohio (392 U.S. 1 (1968))**

**Background**: A detective in Cleveland, Ohio was patrolling the same area he had been patrolling for years when he observed three strangers on a street corner. The detective watched as the men walked one block back and forth 24 times. Each time they passed a particular store front, they would pause and look into the front window. Suspecting the men of casing the store, the detective followed them until they stopped a couple of blocks away. The detective approached them, identified himself as a police officer and began to pat them down. He found two pistols on two out of the three men and removed them. Both men were charged with carrying concealed weapons. The defense moved to suppress the weapons on the grounds that both the stop and the subsequent pat down violated the fourth amendment.

**Decision**: The Supreme court ruled that both the search and seizure were reasonable under the fourth amendment. The court held that when a police officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that someone has, is, or is going to commit a crime he is entitled to detain them for a reasonable amount of time. In addition, when an officer has a suspect detained and he has reasonable suspicion to believe that the suspect is armed, he may frisk the suspect for weapons. In this case, a frisk is considered a “carefully limited search of a person’s outer clothing”.

**What does this mean for you: **An officer may detain a person when the officer believes that the person has, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. In addition, when a person detained and the officer also has reasonable suspicion that the person has weapons on them, he may conduct a pat down of the person’s outer clothing for weapons.

**Chimel v. California  (395 U.S. 752 (1969))**

**Background**: Police officers obtained an arrest warrant on Chimel, and arrested him at his home. After the arrest, Chimel refused when police asked  if they could search his home. Police searched the house anyway “on the basis of a lawful arrest”. Items from the search were used in prosecution against him for burglary. Chimel appealed the decision, claiming his home was subject to an illegal search.

**Decision**: The Court held that the search of Chimel's house was unreasonable under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court reasoned that searches incident to arrest are limited to the area within the immediate control of the suspect. While police could reasonably search and seize evidence on or around the arrestee's person, they were prohibited from rummaging through the entire house without a search warrant.

**What does this mean for you: **When you conduct an arrest you may search the person who you are arresting and the immediate area surrounding said person. You may not search the whole house that the arrestee was standing in.

**Schneckloth v Bustamonte 412 U.S. 218 (1973)**

**Background:**

A California police officer was conducting a routine patrol when he pulled over a vehicle for minor traffic violations. The officer received consent to search the vehicle and found evidence of fraudulent checks during the search. The defendant sought to dismiss the evidence, making the case that he needed to be made aware of his right to refuse a search of his vehicle.

**Decision:**

The court held that the search was constitutional because the defendant gave consent for officers to search his vehicle. The court also determined that it wasn’t the responsibility of the officer to inform the citizen of his right to decline searches.

**What does this mean for you:**

An officer can request permission to search a vehicle regardless of whether the subject is aware that they have the right to refuse. If the subject does refuse, officers cannot search the vehicle unless they have seperate probable cause or a search warrant.

-------------------------

**Pennsylvania v. Mimms  (434 U.S. 106 (1977))**

**Background**: In 1970, two police officers from the Philadelphia Police Department stopped a vehicle driven by Harry Mimms for having an expired license plate. Afterwards the two officers instructed Mr Mimms to step out of the vehicle, to which Mimms’ complied. Upon exiting the vehicle, the officers noticed a bulge under Mimms’ jacket. The officers immediately patted him down and found a handgun on his person. Mimms was then arrested for concealed carrying without a license and was convicted of the crime. Mimms appealed, claiming that his fourth and fourteenth amendment rights were violated when the officers demanded that he exit the vehicle.

**Decision**: The court ruled that it was reasonable for officers to ask the driver to step outside of his vehicle absent of any reasonable suspicion to believe that he was armed. Although officers didn’t have suspicion that Mimms was armed and dangerous, officer safety outweighed the minimally intrusive request to have the Mimms step out. When officers noticed the bulge under Mimms’ jacket, they had reasonable suspicion to frisk him under the ruling in Terry v. Ohio.

**What does this mean for you: **An officer may control the movements of the driver of a vehicle on a traffic stop for any reason. With this, an officer may order the driver out of the vehicle for officer safety. If an officer wants to pat the driver down, he must articulate independent reasonable suspicion in accordance with the court’s ruling in Terry v. Ohio.

For information regarding passengers of the vehicle, see Brendlin v. California.

**Illinois v. Gates (462 U.S. 213 (1983))**

**Background**: The Bloomingdale Police Department received an anonymous tip that Lance and Susan Gates were engaged in drug trafficking. The letter alleged that on May 3rd,  Susan would drive a car down to Florida where it would be then loaded with drugs. The next day, Lance would fly down to Florida, pick up the car, and drive it back to Illinois. The car would be loaded with marijuana worth over $100,000.00. The letter also alleged that they Gates’ also had about $100,000.00 worth of marijuana in their apartment. The tip was assigned to a Bloomingdale PD detective. In the early stages of his investigation, he found that Lance Gates had a flight scheduled to Florida on May 5th. The detective recruited the help of DEA agents and asked them to follow Lance Gates to Florida and report on his actions. They observed Lance Gates fly down to West Palm Beach and take a taxi to a local hotel. He went into a room booked by Melinda Gates for approximately 5 minutes. Lance Gates then exited the room, got into a vehicle registered to the Gates’, and travelled northbound on a road frequently used by people travelling in between Chicago and Florida. A search warrant was subsequently approved for the residence and vehicle of Lance and Susan Gates. When the Gates’ arrived at their residence, they were greeted by Bloomingdale Police who conducted the search warrant. Police found over 350 pounds of marijuana, weapons, and other contraband. The Gates’ were arrested. They moved to suppress the evidence in court, claiming that there wasn’t enough probable cause for the search warrant to be approved.

**Decision**: The supreme court ruled that the search warrant was valid. Although there are some clear cut guidelines that officers can use to establish probable cause, probable cause is more of a “fluid concept” that's inherently based on an “assessment of probabilities”. The supreme court agreed that the anonymous tip wasn’t enough to establish probable cause. However, they determined that the unusual behavior of the Gates’ was verified by the anonymous tip and therefore served as enough probable cause for a search warrant.

**What does this mean for you: **There are some clear cut guidelines on what is needed to establish cause. For example, we know that smelling the odor of marijuana gives officers probable cause to search a vehicle. However, probable cause is fluid and is based largely on how officer’s articulate what they see. When establishing probable cause, officers must examine the totality of circumstances and how a reasonable person would perceive said circumstances.

**United States v. Villamonte-Marquez (462 U.S. 579 (1983))**

**Background:** In 1983, customs officers were patrolling a maritime shipping channel in between the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana when they observed an anchored sailboat. The wake of a passing vessel caused the sailboat to rock violently. The customs officers immediately went over to check the sailboat and make sure everyone was okay. When asked twice about the safety of everyone on board, one occupant shrugged his shoulders in an unresponsive manner.  Based on this, the customs officers decided to board the sailboat and asked to see the vessel's documents. While verifying documents, a customs officer smelled marijuana and  saw wrapped bales of marijuana in plain view  on a lower deck. The occupants of the vessel were arrested for the transportation of marijuana. They appealed their conviction on the grounds that the officers were not legally allowed to board the vessel.

**Decision:** The action of the customs officers in boarding the sailboat was "reasonable," and was therefore consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Waters providing ready access to the open sea is vastly different from the nature of vehicular traffic on highways and the system of outward markings used by states for vehicle registration is also significantly different than the system of external markings on vessels. Moreover, government interest in assuring compliance with vessel documentation requirements is substantial, whereas the type of intrusion made in this case, while not minimal, is limited.

**Meaning to Officers: **A law enforcement officer may make a suspicionless stop on a vessel and board it to check the vessel’s registration and ensure that the vessel has the proper safety equipment on board.

-------------------------

**Tennessee v. Garner (471 U.S. 1 (1985))**

**Background**: Two Memphis police officers arrived on scene after receiving a call about a potential break in. When they arrived, the woman next door informed them that someone was breaking into the adjacent house. When the officers went to investigate, they heard a door slam and saw someone run across the backyard. Officers pursued the suspect until he stopped at the perimeter of the yard that was marked off by a 6 foot high chain link fence. With the aid of a flashlight, the officers were able to see the suspects hands and determined that he was most likely unarmed. When officers began to move in on the suspect, he started to climb over the fence. Convinced that the suspect would elude capture if he made it over the fence, the officer shot him. The bullet hit the subject in the back of the head and passed away shortly after. Ten dollars and a purse taken from the house were found on his body. The suspect’s father sued the state, asserting that the shooting was illegal..

**Decision: **The court ruled in favor of the suspect’s father. Historically, shooting a non-violent fleeing felon would have been permitted under common law. However, the decision in this case makes it clear that this is no longer the case. The supreme court holds that "such force may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others”.

**What this means for you: **An officer may use deadly force against a person if they can articulate a reason(s) to believe that the fleeing suspect poses a significant risk or serious physical harm to the lives of those who may come into contact with the individual after the suspect flees. This is often referred to as the “fleeing felon” rule.

-------------------------

**Graham v. Connor (490 U.S. 386 (1989))**

**Background**: Graham, a diabetic, asked his friend, Berry, to drive him to a convenience store to purchase orange juice to counteract the onset of an insulin reaction. Upon entering the store and seeing the number of people ahead of him, Graham hurried out and asked Berry to drive him to a friend's house instead. A city police officer became suspicious after seeing Graham hastily enter and leave the store. He followed Berry's car and made an investigative stop, ordering the pair to wait while he found out what had happened in the store. Soon after, backup police officers arrived on the scene, handcuffed Graham, and ignored attempts to explain Graham's condition. During the encounter, Graham sustained multiple injuries. He was released when the officers learned that nothing had happened in the store. Graham filed suit against the officers, alleging that they had used excessive force in making the stop.

**Decision:**  The supreme court held that suits involving officer use of force have to be “judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene”. They also held that the court must take into account that officers have to make split second decisions in regards to use of force scenarios. In addition, the court held that the officer’s underlying intent or motivation should not be considered when judging a use of force incident. The supreme court then turned the case over to the lower court for them to make a judgement with that stand

**What does this mean for you:**

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pertaining to incidents with a medical emergencies:</span>

An officer, acting within the scope of his/her duty and in good faith, may use reasonable force to stop and detain an individual believed to be involved in an illegal activity even if the individual is claiming a medical emergency. This does require the officer to use good judgement in this decision, and a medical response may be in the officer’s best interest. However, in instances where the officer is acting in good faith, the court will not rule against any officer’s actions used to detain or clear the individual of any illegal activity.  


    _Note that we always recommend requesting medical when a detained subject is claiming to have a medical emergency. However, we do recognize that there are limited circumstances where requesting medical would be unreasonable. It is up to the discretion of your policy and/or the Courts to determine whether the “good faith” exception applies here._

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Pertaining to all use of force cases going forward:</span>

Use of force should be judged by the objective reasonableness standard rather than a due process standard. This means that we should be looking at the information that the officers had at the time and determining what a reasonable officer would’ve done. This doesn't mean that we should be Monday night quarterbacking use of force decisions with full 20/20 vision.

**Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990)**

**Background**: On January 13, 1985, Erwin Paul Wallaker, the treasurer of the San Jose Coin Club, returned home with the proceeds from the annual coin convention, which Terry Horton attended. Upon entering his garage, two robbers accosted Wallaker; one was armed with a machine gun and the other with an electric shocking device. They threw him to the ground, shocked him, bound him, and robbed him of jewelry and cash. During this interaction, Wallaker was able to identify Horton by the sound of his voice. The three witnesses who discovered Wallaker partially corroborated his identification of Horton. In addition, they saw someone leaving the scene carrying what looked like an umbrella. Sergeant LaRault determined there was enough evidence to search Horton’s home, and obtained a warrant to do so. The warrant only granted him permission to search for the stolen property. When police conducted the search of Horton’s house, they did not find the property. However, they found an Uzi machine gun, a .38 caliber revolver, two stun guns, a handcuff key, and other various items linking Horton to the crime. The evidence was deemed admissible at trial, and Horton was found guilty.

**Decision: **The seizure of evidence in plain view does not constitute the invasion of privacy that the Fourth Amendment is meant to prohibit. Once an officer has a warrant to search a suspect’s house, that officer may seize any obviously incriminating evidence that the officer finds in plain view. The Court also held that the “inadvertent” limitation does not limit the scope of the search further than the warrant itself does. In this case, since the warrant was specifically for the stolen property, the officer had to limit his search to the likely places where the property might be kept. Since the officer also had probable cause to believe that certain types of weapons were used in the commission of the crime, he could legally seize the weapons if they were found in the course of that search.

**What this means for you: **As required by the fourth amendment of the US Constitution, a legal warrant must be specific, and the searching officer may only search in areas where the items on the warrant could be found. If police find contraband not related to the search, they may seize the items found but must continue to search only for items originally listed in the search warrant. I.E.: While conducting a search warrant for narcotics you find contraband pertaining to a recent bank robbery. You are authorized to seize the evidence pertaining to the robbery, but you can only continue to look for narcotics. That officer may then obtain another search warrant for items from the robbery, citing the evidence he found in plain view whilst conducting the first search warrant.

-------------------------

**Whren v. United States  (517 U.S. 806 (1996))**

**Background**: Plainclothes policemen patrolling a "high drug area" in an unmarked vehicle observed a truck waiting at a stop sign at an intersection for an unusually long time. The truck then turned suddenly, without signaling, and sped off at an "unreasonable" speed. The officers stopped the vehicle and upon approaching the truck observed plastic bags of crack cocaine in Whren's hands. Whren was arrested. Whren moved for suppression of the evidence, arguing that the officers’ decision to stop them was motivated by an unsubstantiated suspicion of drug dealing and not a genuine concern regarding the manner in which the vehicle was being operated.

**Decision**: The Court held that as long as officers have a reasonable cause to believe that a traffic violation occurred, they may stop any vehicle. Since the traffic stop was deemed legal, the ensuing search and seizure of the offending vehicle was legal, regardless of what other personal motivations the officers might have had for stopping the vehicle.

**What does this mean for you: **An officer may stop a vehicle if they have reasonable suspicion that the driver has committed a traffic infraction. The court does not need to determine if the officer had other reasons for the stop (finding DUI, Drugs, etc).


    Example: A DUI unit is looking for drunk drivers near a bar that just closed for the night. The officer sees a vehicle exiting the bar who failed to make a complete stop at a stop sign. The officer may stop the vehicle for the stop sign violation even though his primary motivation for making the stop is to conduct a DUI investigation.

**Maryland v. Pringle (540 U.S. 366 (2003))**

**Background:** While on a traffic stop, the driver gave police consent to search the car. After searching the car, officers seized $750.00 from the glove compartment and 5 baggies of cocaine from behind the armrest in the back seat. The officer arrested everyone in the vehicle after they all denied ownership of the drugs and money. They were all initially charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine.

**Decision: **In a unanimous opinion by the Supreme Court, the Court ruled that the officer had probable cause to arrest all of the occupants of the vehicle. It is reasonable for the officer to believe that any or all of the car’s occupants either knew about the cocaine or owned it. In addition, an officer could find probable cause to believe that only specific people in the vehicle had committed the crime.

**What this means for Law Enforcement:**

When illegal drugs are found in a vehicle and nobody claims ownership of the substance, you can arrest all occupants of the vehicle. In addition, if you can articulate that only specific people in the vehicle have ownership of the substance, you have the discretion to only arrest those specific people.  

It is also worthy to note that if the cocaine was found on someone’s person, the officer would lack probable cause to arrest the other occupants of the vehicle.

Keep in mind that this case wouldn’t just apply to illegal drugs, but it would apply to any illegal items within the vehicle (i.e. illegal firearms).

**Illinois v. Caballes (543 US 405 (2005))**

**Background**: A trooper stopped Roy Caballes for speeding on an interstate highway. When the trooper informed dispatch of the stop, a member of the state police's drug interdiction squad overheard the report and proceeded to the location of the stop. When the drug officer arrived, Caballes was in the trooper's car while the trooper was writing out a warning ticket. The drug officer walked his drug-sniffing dog around Caballes' car, and the dog alerted at the trunk. Inside the trunk, the officers found marijuana. The traffic stop lasted less than 10 minutes. Caballes was convicted. The Illinois Supreme Court reversed the conviction stating that the officer did no had reasonable suspicion to have the dog sniff the vehicle.

**Decision: **The Supreme Court's 7-2 opinion that Caballes' Fourth Amendment rights were not violated. The Constitution did not require police to have reasonable suspicion to use a drug-detection dog on a car during a legal traffic stop. No legitimate privacy was at risk, the Court argued, because the dog only alerted to an illegal drug.

**What does this mean for you: **An officer may have a drug dog sniff a vehicle on a traffic stop without reasonable suspicion as long as it doesn’t prolong the stop.  If the officer does reasonable suspicion to believe there are drugs in the vehicle he may prolong the stop and wait for a drug dog.

**Muehler v. Mena  (544 U.S. 93 (2005))**

**Background**: Police conducted a search warrant on a residence that Mena was in. The search warrant was for deadly weapons and the evidence of gang activity. Police detained Mena in handcuffs while they searched the residence and questioned her regarding her immigration status while she was detained.

**Decision**: The Court held that Mena's detention did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Officers with a search warrant have the authority to detain occupants of the premises during the search in order to minimize the risk involved. Handcuffing Mena while police searched for weapons was also justified for officer safety. In addition, questioning Mena about her immigration status was lawful. Police questioning is not considered a search or seizure under the fourth amendment.

**What does this mean for you: **When conducting a search warrant, officers may detain the occupants of the premises for officer safety.

**Brendlin v. California (551 U.S. 249 (2007))**

**Background**: After initiating a traffic stop on a vehicle, officers visually identified the passenger to be Bruce Brendlin, a man who had a warrant for his arrest for violating parole. After arresting Brendlin, a search of the vehicle and Brendlin’s person was conducted. They found methamphetamine paraphernalia on his person and he was subsequently charged with Possession of a Controlled Substance. Brendlin moved to suppress that evidence because  he was the passenger of the vehicle, he wasn’t the primary focus of the traffic stop, and therefore not detained by officers.

**Decision**: The Supreme Court ruled that although Brendlin was not the primary focus of the stop, he was still subject to some scrutiny, especially when he was visually identified by officers. In addition, the supreme court ruled that he was detained by officers and not free to leave without the officer’s approval. In United States v. Mendenhall, the supreme court said that a person is considered detained by officers when a reasonable person would understand that they are not free to leave. In this case, the supreme court ruled that even though Brendlin was the passenger of the vehicle, a reasonable person in his shoes would understand that they are not free to leave.

**What does this mean for you: **An officer has the right to control the movement of all occupants of the vehicle, regardless of the primary objective of the traffic stop.  The officer has sole discretion on whether he would like passengers to remain in the vehicle or get out of the vehicle. It should be noted that just because an officer asks the passenger out of a vehicle, it does not mean that they’re free to leave. They would still be detained until the officer has concluded the traffic stop.

**Arizona v. Gant (556 U.S. 332 (2008))**

**Background**: Gant was arrested for driving on a suspended license before officers searched his car and found cocaine in a jacket pocket. The Arizona trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence, and he appealed.

**Decision:** The State Supreme Court utilised _New York_ v. _Belton_, which upheld that the police can search a passenger compartment/area of a vehicle and any containers within it at incident of a recent occupant’s lawful arrest—on the ground that it concerned the scope of a search incident (essentially that it will aid the investigation) to arrest but did not answer the question whether officers may conduct such a search once the scene has been secured. Because _Chimel _v. _California_, requires that a search which is resulting from arrest be justified by either the interest in officer safety or the interest in preserving evidence. The circumstances of Gant’s arrest found neither of those interests applicable, The Court found the search **unreasonable.**

**What does this mean for you:  **Police can search the passenger compartment of a vehicle incident to a recent occupant’s arrest only if it is reasonable to believe that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest.

**Arizona v. Johnson (555 U.S. 323 (2009))**

**Background**: Officers with Arizona’s Gang Task Force initiated a traffic stop on a vehicle upon finding out that the registration of said vehicle was suspended. They questioned each of the three occupants and confirmed that one of the passengers, Montrea Johnson, had an affiliation with a gang. The officer also noticed that he was wearing a blue bandana which was consistent with membership in the Crips. The officer wanted to question Johnson away from the other passengers to gain intelligence about the gang he might be in. Based on Johnson’s answers to the initial questions, officers suspected that he might have a gun on him, and patted him down to check for weapons. They found an illegal firearm on his person and arrested him. Johnson moved to suppress the evidence in court, arguing that the search was a violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments.

**Decision**: The supreme court ruled that the search on Johnson was legal. As established in other cases above, officers have the right to control the movement of passengers. Furthermore, those passengers are detained regardless of the initial reason for the stop. The court concluded that if you take those facts and look at them through the lens of Terry v. Ohio, a passenger may be patted down if an officer has reasonable suspicion that they are armed and dangerous.

**What does this mean for you: **If an officer has reasonable suspicion to believe an occupant of a vehicle on a traffic stop is armed, the officer may ask that person out of the vehicle and pat them down, regardless of whether the occupant was the driver of the vehicle or not.

**Kentucky v. King** ([563 US 452 (2011)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/563/452))

**Background**: Officers in Lexington, Ky., entered an apartment building in pursuit of a suspect who sold crack cocaine to an undercover informant. The officers lost sight of the suspect and mistakenly assumed he entered an apartment from which they could detect the odor of marijuana. After police knocked on the door and identified themselves, they heard movements, which they believed indicated evidence was about to be destroyed. Police forcibly entered the apartment and found Hollis King and others smoking marijuana. They also found cash, drugs and paraphernalia. King entered a conditional guilty plea; reserving his right to appeal denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained from what he argued was an illegal search. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, holding that exigent circumstances supporting the warrantless search were not of the police's making and that police did not engage in deliberate and intentional conduct to evade the warrant requirement. In January 2010, the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed the lower court order, finding that the entry was improper. The court held that the police were not in pursuit of a fleeing suspect when they entered the apartment, since there was no evidence that the original suspect even knew he was being followed by police. 

**Decision**: Law Enforcement does not violate the Fourth Amendment simply by creating exigency. Exigency which violates the Fourth Amendment occurs only when the conduct creating the exigency also violates the Constitution. . 

**What does this mean for you: **If an officer has reasonable suspicion to believe an occupant of a home is about to destroy evidence under exigent circumstances, officers are allowed to search the home without a warrant.
